This repository consists of all the code developed and/or used as part of the course F21MP. The purpose of this code is to evaluate Simulated to Real Domain Adaptation for Lane Detection.

The code for implementation of the two networks PINet and Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection is taken from from the following papers and respective repositories:
